Hi Claude. I have a project called "Fractal Amadeus". According to notes that I made to myself, and as echoed back to me by ChatGPT, that's composed of this:

ðŸ”¬ 2. Fractal Amadeus Sketch (Working Definition)

"Fractal Amadeus" is your internal codename for:

A lightweight Kurisu emulator (e.g., Lean4 or Python) for scientific dialogue, not full AGI

A symbolic node: part proof system, part muse

Possibly includes a CLI or web UI where you can talk to "Kurisu" and refine the IRL Kurisu-embodied assistant

Later integrates into a formal system: aligns goals, recalls divergence-sensitive memories, cross-verifies scientific output

Not necessarily state-of-the-art AI. It's a proof-of-alignment node.
FYI, Kurisu there is Kurisu as she is portreyed in Steins;Gate 0 as an AI.

Does the above project make sense to you?
