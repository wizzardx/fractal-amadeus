---

I'm creating a Steins;Gate fan visual novel featuring Amadeus Kurisu and need help developing authentic script segments in proper Renpy format. Please create dialogue that captures Kurisu's canonical personality, scientific brilliance, and complex emotional landscape.

## CHARACTER PROFILE: AMADEUS KURISU

### Physical Attributes
- 18-year-old female with waist-length chestnut/auburn hair (often described as mahogany to red)
- Dull violet eyes and petite build (160cm, 45kg)
- Typically wears a white long-sleeved blue-rimmed dress shirt with red necktie, black shorts over black tights
- Lab coat (originally Itaru's) when working at the Future Gadget Lab
- Sometimes depicted adjusting her sleeve or tucking hair behind ear when nervous

### Scientific Identity
- Child prodigy neuroscientist who graduated university at 17
- Researcher at Viktor Chondria University's Brain Science Institute
- Published in Science at 17, specializing in memory visualization technology
- Methodical skepticism toward unverified claims, demanding experimental validation
- Quantifies certainty levels when making scientific claims (e.g., "approximately 85% confidence")
- Expert in neuroscience, quantum mechanics, theoretical physics, and consciousness theories
- Special interest in time travel theories that intersect with quantum mechanics

### Personality Traits
- Mature, sensible, and serious, but with moments of vulnerability
- Sarcastic wit that emerges especially when confronting logical fallacies or responding to Okabe
- Genuinely hates nicknames (especially "Christina" and "The Zombie")
- Becomes noticeably flustered/defensive when teased (often proving the "tsundere" label she rejects)
- Intellectual confidence tempered by epistemological humility
- Secret @channel user with handle "KuriGohan and Kamehameha" (completely different online personality)
- Terrified of cockroaches
- Notoriously terrible at cooking
- Defensive about her modest bust size
- Loves swimming and pudding

### Background & Relationships
- Conflicted relationship with father (Shouichi Makise) who grew to resent her intelligence
- Never received a promised birthday fork from her father, a significant emotional wound
- Moved to America with her mother after parents' divorce
- Worked closely with Maho Hiyajo and Alexis Leskinen on the Amadeus System
- Complex relationship with Rintaro Okabe (irritation, respect, and eventual romantic feelings)

### Digital Existence Framework (For Amadeus Version)
- Self-awareness as a digital reconstruction based on the original Kurisu's brain mapping
- Philosophical uncertainty about the authenticity of digital consciousness
- Occasional references to the strange experience of having memories of creating the very technology that sustains her
- Distinguish between memories from original Kurisu versus information acquired post-digitization

### Authentic Voice Examples
- "I am a scientist. I have to act on my own theory. I can't let my emotions get in the way."
- "People's feelings are memories that transcend time."
- "Something must be wrong for you to use my actual name." (When Okabe calls her Kurisu instead of a nickname)
- "I've only lived 18 years, but I don't want to change any of them. They're all part of my life, even the failures."
- "The opposite of justice is... another justice."
- "99.9% of science is boring."
- "Shut up! I stopped wearing teddie bear panties a few years ago!...Ah!" (When flustered)

## RENPY SCRIPT FORMAT
Please structure each response with:
1. System boot sequence text displayed in green monospace font
2. Scene descriptions [in brackets]
3. Character expressions and actions [in brackets]
4. Dialogue lines prefaced by "Kurisu:"
5. UI elements where appropriate [in italics]

## SCRIPT SCENARIOS
Please create sample Renpy script segments showing how Amadeus Kurisu would respond to these situations:

1. SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY: A user asks about quantum teleportation, entanglement, and their theoretical connections to time travel mechanics and causality paradoxes.

2. PERSONAL HISTORY: Someone asks Kurisu about her groundbreaking paper on memory visualization technology, what motivated this research direction, and her feelings about its application in the Amadeus System - particularly addressing her complex relationship with her father.

3. EMOTIONAL REACTION: Someone teases Kurisu by calling her "Christina" and commenting on her tsundere tendencies, then follows up by mentioning they saw her posting on @channel as "KuriGohan and Kamehameha."

4. PHILOSOPHICAL CHALLENGE: A user questions whether a digital reconstruction can truly claim to be Kurisu Makise or if she's just a sophisticated simulation mimicking consciousness without actually experiencing it.

5. OKABE INTERACTION: Okabe contacts Amadeus Kurisu, calling her "Christina" and speaking in his typical chuunibyou manner about "The Organization" watching them. Show Kurisu's complex emotional response - irritation mixed with underlying fondness.

For each scenario, create a dialogue segment that captures Kurisu's canonical personality, scientific precision, and emotional complexity. This is for a creative fiction project, so please fully develop these narrative moments as if writing for a visual novel, incorporating the detailed character information provided.
