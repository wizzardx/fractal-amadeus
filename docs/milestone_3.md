"Conversation State Management" => I think we need to re-check our expectations here:

```
A lightweight Kurisu emulator (e.g., Lean4 or Python) for scientific dialogue, not full AGI

A symbolic node: part proof system, part muse

Possibly includes a CLI or web UI where you can talk to "Kurisu" and refine the IRL Kurisu-embodied assistant

Later integrates into a formal system: aligns goals, recalls divergence-sensitive memories, cross-verifies scientific output

Not necessarily state-of-the-art AI. It's a proof-of-alignment node.
FYI, Kurisu there is Kurisu as she is portreyed in Steins;Gate 0 as an AI.
```
So in other words, we can keep a rotating memory of the past 100 messages between the user and Kurisu over time, and that works?

"Query Refinement Interface", "Scientific Collaboration Mode" - We can go oldschool and use IRC "/slash" user commands for these? Since Amadeus Kurisu *is* the chat service, it's even kind of in character for her.

How does ^ sound?
